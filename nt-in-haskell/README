Natural Transformations in Haskell workshop

I'm assuming you've followed all the instructions on
https://gitorious.org/nt-in-haskell/pages/Quickstart .

If you're following the materials for independent study: the files in
src/NT/ are meant to be read in order, though you may skip E.hs if it
doesn't sound interesting.  These files, though they compile with GHC,
consist of many explanatory comments, exercises, and a bit of code.

Some, but not all, exercises involve filling in parts of the existing
code.  You get warnings from the compiler until you do so.  Typically,
when the code compiles without type errors/warnings, you have solved
the exercise.

Exercises are in comments, and look like this:

    Exercise R1: Find Exercise A1 in src/NT/A.hs.

Answers to the exercises are primarily in a bzr branch descended from
this one, mirrored to git.

bzr: lp:nt-in-haskell/answers
git: https://gitorious.org/nt-in-haskell/answers.git

Contributions are welcome via bzr, under this project's license, the
AGPLv3, a copy of which is included in LICENSE.  The main project page
