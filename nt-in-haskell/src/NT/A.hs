What are we talking about?

We won't be talking about all natural transformations, but those of a
particular type, because that type is interesting to talk about in
Haskell.

All functions of type forall a. f a -> g a, for some f and g.

listToMaybe :: [a] -> Maybe a (f = [], g = Maybe)
reverse :: [a] -> [a] (f = [], g = [])
lift :: m a -> t m a (f = m, g = t m, MonadTrans t, Monad m)
liftIO :: IO a -> m a (f = IO, g = m, MonadIO m)
(. length) :: (Int -> a) -> [t] -> a (f = (->) Int, g = (->) [t])

We're going to use the shorthand "natural transformation" for this
type.  We can create a newtype for it, but remember that nothing
really changes about the value when you wrap or unwrap in a newtype,
so it is only for convenience and dealing with Haskell type rules.

newtype NT f g = NT {runNT :: forall a. f a -> g a}

{-
Now you can try expressions like this, to see if NT can pick out
the f and g involved.

Î»> :t NT lift
NT lift :: (MonadTrans t, Monad m) => NT m (t m)

    Exercise A1: Do the same for the other functions mentioned above.
    What are their inferred 'f' and 'g'?

    Exercise A2: What are the kinds of the 'f' and 'g' arguments to
    the 'NT' type constructor?  What about the 'a' after the 'forall'?
